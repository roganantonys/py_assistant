# Antony_Assiatant

In this project i am creating a simple voice assistant like Alexa,Google Assistant in python.I named this assistant as "Antony"(you can name it as whatever you like).At first it will greet us and then wait for our command for certain time 

It can perform multiple functions :-

   1.playing music/video from youtube.

   2.it can tell the current time.

   3.it can tell some jokes(for fun part)

   4.it can describe about anyone refering from wikipedia for exactly 20 lines(we can change the number of lines in code)

   5.we can also modify the code further to send whatsapp messages to anyone(it is not included in this code)

   6.we can tell our assistant to open any websites(this feature is not included in this code)


IMPLEMENTATIONS:

1.At first we need to import some of the important modules like speech regoniztion,speech to text,datetime,pywhatkit,wikipedia,pyjokes

2.using the speech recogniztion it recognizes the user's input 

3.it then convert those voice data to text using speech to text for further process

4.By giving the appropriate comment it will open youtbe or tell jokes or tell the current time.
